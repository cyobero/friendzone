FriendZone is a Q&A site devoted to helping users with dating and relationship advice. The goal of FriendZone is to allow users to ask dating and relationship advice and get the most **unbiased** answers from other users. To this end, a user profile on FriendZone has no link to social media accounts. We believe that by not making presumptions about another user, this will enable other users to focus on the question at hand and give as much of an unbiased opinion possible. However, users are free to divulge as much personal information they want in asking a question.
